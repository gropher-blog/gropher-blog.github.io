2nd day, got office at around 9am, grabbed a coffee on ground floor and had toaster at kitchen.

9:30am, joined the Stand Up meeting, got the baseball from Aaron followed by a short self introduction, then passed the ball to the next.

VG showed the PDF defect, Lashimi introducted Fitnesse and svn.

Had beef and rice at China Bar, not as good as expected. Will go to the Vietnamese tomorrow.

75 tram took 1 hour and 20 mins in the morning to get me in city, and about 50 mins at evening back home.

Luke called in the morning, just checked how it went the first day, will catch up later in weeks.
