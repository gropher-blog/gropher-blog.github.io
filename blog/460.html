<p>往停车场走，Daisy打来电话说车票不能取消，已经出了6张，觉得今天运气特别差，接着说到CEO发的邮件，说邮件里的人是yyq。</p>

<p>我第一次听的模糊，又问了一次，确认是yq名字的时候，禁不住大叫“不是吧”！</p>

<p>事情如果不是发生在身边，就不会有那么真切的感受。Daisy说去芬兰前，yq刚刚在她那里挑了衣服，我也想到上周还和她在会议里说话聊天，刚刚才在weibo上互相关注。</p>

<p>我问Daisy，确定吗，她回答90%吧，Cindy也有同样的消息。我说具体是什么原因，怎么回事，她说不知道，还在调查。</p>

<p>挂了电话，继续顺着人群往停车场走，感觉和生命相比，身边发生的所有事情都显得微不足道。与人的争执，生活的恐惧，未来的担忧，利益的计较。觉得最应该做的就是珍惜眼前拥有的东西，按照自己的意愿生活，不要踌躇犹豫，不要浪费时间。</p>
